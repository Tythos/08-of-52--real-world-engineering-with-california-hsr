# [08/52] Real World Engineering With California HSR

We are going to do something completely different today. I've mentioned several times that I'd like to try and do more traditional engineering-focused content, and while we'll still cover a wide array of software topics, this is our first "stab" into my actual background as a practical systems engineer.

Modern engineering can be very interesting when you consider how it folds into interesting cases across a wide variety of practices and projects, and today's case study is no exception. There are a couple of places our investigation will go, but today we're going to look at a "Finance and Audit Committee" meeting for the California HSR (High Speed Rail) project.

I haven't watched this one before, though I've been very interested in previous meetings. So, this is a "reaction" to that most thrilling of topics, engineering finance and auditing. We are specifically going to look at this meeting from the lens of an engineer--someone who is interested in these sorts of projects, but is perhaps baffled (and a little puzzled) by why they are doing so poorly.

## It Begins

First, some brief roll call and other parlimentary actions. So far, so good. And of course the obligatory "press this button if you're on Zoom" instructions.

Some background! Here, in the wonderful state of California, there have been a number of efforts to build improved and modernized rail systems. The current effort (with some preliminary ideas floated as early as the mid-90s) for high-speed rail has been going on for some time, with a "starting line" commonly measured at the passing of Proposition 1A in 2008. This proposition authorized a large bond for project funding at just under $10,000,000,000.00.

Of course, it hasn't finished yet, 16 years later, and it's substantially over budget. Way above cost, way behind schedule. So, it's interesting to listen into "Finance and Audit" because if you look at the project as a whole, especially as an engineering project (wondering about what are the cost controls and schedule controls), what is pushing this project to such an extent that it makes defense contracts look good?

For starters, it's California--and you'll see exactly how some of those things fold in. But from an engineering project perspective as well, some of those iterations are very interesting (and they'll reference some of them in the meeting). But the main takeaway I've had from listening to some of these meetings is, not so much the project as a whole, but this committee as a microcosm of the whole project, that you get interesting insights into how they are functioning and what their priorities are and what impacts that might have or reveal about the project as a whole.

To give you an idea of just how much the goalposts have moved, consider San Fransico (a well-populated area) and Southern California (another well-populated area). They are connected by California HSR on a map but only by off-colored lines that indicate they are still undergoing environmental review. If you know California projects (and that these can still be under protest), then you know that is a decades-long process.

What they *are* building are not the dashed lines between Bakersfield and Merced (that is under "Pre-construction"). They are building the *solid* line ("Under Construction") between Madiera and Fresno, down through Kings-Tulare, and then stopping a few dozen miles short of Bakersfield.

So, if you want to travel to the Bay Area from somewhere like where I live in Southern California, you need to either wait several more decades for these end segments to be finished, or you travel up here north of Bakersfield, hop on the rail, and then get off at Madeira and find some way to transit the rest of the way to San Francisco.

Or you could hop on a plane and be there for around $60 for a Southwest special 90 minutes.

You can imagine what the economic feasibility of this project is.

## Disputes

Paying aging disputes is a priority. There are $139,000,000.00 in disputed invoices currently booked on the program. Now, this does represent a $62,000,000.00 *decrease*.

California's budget (while smaller than the federal government of course) is *just* big enough for most of these items to be rounding errors. But it's small enough to have a real impact when it adds up year after year.

Surely when an invoice is submitted with changes pending that naturally leads to a disputed payment! (I'm using some sarcasm here.) On a practical level these are very different activities, and you really come to appreciate this when you hear (throughout the remainder of the meeting) just how many changes (pending and otherwise) there are throughout the project activities. Disputes happen--does that mean they're pending!?

Of course, this is a state project, but this is a good place to bring up Nunn-McCurdy. By comparison, there's this constraint on DoD acquisitions: A contract or project gets in big trouble when its cost per unit goes above 25% the original projections. (And I thought there was a time constraint as well but I couldn't find it.)

Would you like to guess if California HSR (if it was a federal project) had breached Nunn-McCurdy yet?

Proposition advertised a cost of just under $10 billion, recall.

Including early investments, the total balance of project expenditures is now... north of $30 billion.

How strange!

Now, there is real merit on projects in the idea that, what you want to keep track of are the month-to-month and year-to-year changes. Is it going up? Is it going down? They're focusing so much on that here, though, without ever asking any of the big questions like: "Why *are* there so many disputed invoices?" "Why *are* we two or three times over the original budget?" And so on.

## Sales

Could we sell excess properties formerly used for construction staging?

Gasp! But that would *bring in revenue*! We can't have that on a state project!

One of the other things I find very interesting is, notice this is the "Finance and Audit" committee. Typically auditing is something that is *TO* your finances. This is very much a fox-watching-the-henhouse situation.

After all, we can't sell those properties now, we might *need* them in the future!

Can we anticipate some of that revenue to come back? In other words, can we *book* on it? (These are not serious accounting questions, and completely out of line with GAAP, or Generally Accepted Accounting Practices.)

They've sold 7 or 8... and for about a million dollars in proceeds.

There is a concept of something in engineering projects called NRE (non-recoverable expenditure) or NRI (non-recoverable investment). I guarantee you none of the land purcahses can be booked as recoverable.

But... they're running "under" budget! Of course, this is the *administrative* budget, which is $93,000,000.00 for the previous year.

Keep in mind this project has been going on for 20 years, and is currently scoped at $30 billion--so, roughly $1.5 billion each year on average. So, $100 million for purely administrative cost represents about 7% of the overal expenditures.

## The Big Problem

This is true across all California engineering projects. When there's a big pile of money, everyone wants it. So when you have a big budget, and you throw big piles of money at projects, everyone wants it. Can you imagine what $100 million in administration gets you?

Executivee summaries of capital outlays don't help here either. For the fiscal year, it's $1.8 billion--but the *monthly* expenditure is $186 million. Do they think there are only 10 months in the year? #CaliforniaMaths

Part of that was a $25 million insurance payment last month. *Payment*.

The most interesting line item, though, is the "Right of Way". This is probably the most significant item for explaning the state of the project as it is. I mentioned the "pile of money" problem. One of the places where people try and grab the pile of money is the right-of-way and third-party. What are other people spending, what were you expecting to spend, how much do you actually have to fork over to get that missing mile? Answers vary widely and the longer you wait the more expensive it's going to be (not counting the "sunk cost fallacy" that drives your own decision logic as a project).

This is particularly true when spending money for property, when it already exists and is already used for other things.

## Building Rail Logic

This is an interesting comparison. California HSR intended for their "videos" page (on YouTube) to be an advertisement for the project as a whole. Look at this overpass! Look at this right-of-way and grade separation!

Let's look at one in particular, the Tule River Viaduct. Check that out. That is a huge-ass viaduct. To cross over that 80-foot river. HUGE. ASS. VIADUCT.

For no particular reason, let's pull up something to compare it to. Side-by-side, let's compare it to *this* bridge, about two dozen miles north of downtown Tokyo, one of the most heavily-populated areas in the world. I haven't actually looked at this before, so let's see what we see.

This bridge starts from here, at grade, and ends *at grade* on the other side. In fact, there's a pair of bridges. Hrm, that's so strange!

Now let's go back to the California HSR viaduct, being built over flat, open farmland.

What sort of considerations do you think go into making engineering decisions like this?

## Stakeholder Downselection

One big problem with modern engineering projects is an early stage in the systems engineering process that goes by the term "Stakeholder Downselection".

First, you have to "Identify Your Stakeholders". But, you can't take a vote every time there's a penny that needs to be spent. You have to have some way to *represent* that slice of stakeholders within the project. So, there is a downselection process that has to take place.

This is difficult, and I don't envy people who have to make these choices, because what you're effectively telling people is: "Bob, you can come to the meeting. We will take *your* objections seriously! Alice, Charlie--write down what you think is important, we'll think about it. But Bob's in charge of making sure your opinions are represented.

So, when you think about the engineering considerations for projects like this, those engineering decisions are largely defined by which stakeholders have what priority, when it comes to the strategic direction of the project. So, the pressure will always be to *increase* the number of stakeholders in the project. There's very little pressure, until it reaches the point of potentially failing the project outright, on *decreasing* the number of stakeholders. And this step ("Stakeholder Downselection") may be skipped entirely as a result.

The number of stakeholders, instead, will almost always be going *up*. More voices, more chefs in the kitchen, more people trying to get their hands on the big "pile of money", on the big pile of $10 billion state bond funds that has long since vanished.

## California Problems

You see this problem show up everywhere. In California, NGOs are a particularly big problem as far as stakeholder downselection is concerned, because their voice is a very serious component of risk to the project, when it comes to politically sensitive projects that need statewide buy-in.

There's *A LOT* of really good examples we could pull on here.

There is a bus stop sunshade in Los Angeles called "La Sombrita". Lots of very interesting non-profit inputs in terms of stakeholder downselection--it was not *DOWNSELECTED*, it was *EXPANDED*. The eventualy unit cost was $10,000 for each prototype. (And $50,000 to install. After $200,000 in grant money for the initial study.)

This... is a $10,000 sunshade. And costs several times for installation. So it cost more to install it than it did to make the original device. There are a lot of rules gleaned from across a lot of organizations for projects like that.

Here's another great California engineering example: Nets were installed to catch people trying to jump off of the Golden Gate bridge. It took *several years*. Remember, Nunn-McCurdy was 25% over and you report to Congress; 50% over and your project gets cancelled. These nets were originally budgeted at $76 million, construction costs rose to $224 million. To install nets.

What do you think the Golden Gate Bridge originally cost? More than $35 million ($590 million in 2022 dollars). For *HALF* the cost of the entire bridge--that's how much it took to install nets.

All these things are good projects to do! They are *GOOD THINGS TO DO*. Of course. That goes without saying. But how are they being managed as engineering projects? What sort of cost and schedule controls exist? And why is it *uniquely* bad in California?

## Construction Estimates

Now we're 16 years in (surprising!) and they're still discovering new things to do. In this month, only 50% have started relocation. But all of these numbers are *successes* in their mind--they've bought *this much* land, they've spend *this much* money, there are *this many* people working on construction.

"Are we going to finish the right of way this year?"

"No. But now it's Dennis's turn to talk."

Poor Dennis. Sorry, Dennis! Here's the bus. *BAM!*

There are design changes, and that means these processes have to be started over. (This is a key hallmark of poor planning.) "Design changes" are another term for "moving goalposts", or "requirements creep", as we call it in systems engineering.

"How many will we have left by the end of 2024?"

"I don't know."

This may very well be the single biggest problem with accountability and auditing on the project--but no one has any clue.

## Success

And in the meantime, there's lots of comments! Comments everywhere. Lots of comments to include and consider for projects approved by statewide measure 16 years ago. 

But November was a very strong month! And this really is the secret.

*What does success look like?* Every other sentance gives you another little glimpse into what the objectives are and what the metrics are for success--that is, success of this committee in particular and of the project as a whole. "Success" is, "we were able to spend money."

I do love his accent, though--just a slight bit of Irish.

And you'll notice bikeshedding is a huge problem in these organizations. "Excuse me, can you verify that my division problem for me?" But in the meantime the big elephant questions go un-asked.

But they're only 45 or 60 days behind! Of course, that's for this particular reporting, which is not up to date for the meeting. The project itself... is another story.

And did that sound like an answer to his question? "We'll give it to you later!" I can't tell you, from actual city council events and other similar activities--no one ever gives it to you later!--how many times people have just "oh, yeah, I'll tell you after the meeting"--never happens.

## Utility Relocation

I find telecom utility relocation particularly interesting, out of these four. That's the one where, 90% of the infrastructure for relocation probably didn't exist 16 year ago (since it's so modernization-heavy) when the project originally started. So, the project started; then it was built; and now it has to be relocated for an effort that had already began.

What would really be an interesting follow-on to this conversation is, to go back into the historical records and look to compare, because at this level these numbers are going to be constantly adjusted and adjusted to present the best possible picture for the recent stage. How long has this been 98%? What were these numbers look like 10 years ago?

And surely enough, despite finalizing right-of-way refactoring a few years ago, it was supposed to be at 98.5% a while back! What possibly could have happened?

And we all know construction will stay on schedule for 24/25! Right? They're counting on it, they're *booking* on continuous delays across the project, including engineering activities.

## Other Comparisons

Compare that to the Brightline that just opened two years ago, in December 2022 (with extended service to Orlando and West Palm Beach fall of 2023).

The really interesting thing here is going to be the LA to Las Vegas. It is not at all clear to me--even though they're taking realistic funding (several times more than Florida0)--that... well, I'm not sure this is going to be anywhere near enough for California issues.

And have I mentioned Morocco yet?

I'll bet the contractors working over the holidays wasn't cheap. But again, what are the metrics for success? People are working, we're doing great!

## Conclusion

I'm not sure what interesting follow-up there could be--certaintly, lots of directions we *could* go. Other projects we could compare, etc. Hopefully you found that as interesting as I did.

We might also try and explore a wider, lower-level engineering idea I'd like to explore. But until then, take care.
